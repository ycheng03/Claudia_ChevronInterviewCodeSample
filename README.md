# Claudia_ChevronInterviewCodeSample

This repository contains two folders: `BankingsSystem` and `LeetcodeProblems`.


## Banking System

The 'BankingsSystem' folder contains a complete project that simulates a simple banking system written in C++. The project allows users to create an account with a name, address, and initial deposit, view their account balance and transaction history, deposit and withdraw money from their account, and transfer money to another user's account. The implementation uses modern C++ features such as smart pointers and exception handling, and a hash table data structure to store and retrieve user and account information efficiently.

Please refer to the banking-system folder's README for more information on its implementation details.


## LeetcodeProblems

The `LeetcodeProblems` folder contains two subfolders: `4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays` and `42. Trapping Rain Water`, each containing a solution to a LeetCode hard-level problem written in Java and C++, respectively.

* `4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays` contains a solution to problem #4 in Java.
* `42. Trapping Rain Water` contains a solution to problem #42 in C++.

**Please refer to the respective subfolders' README for more information on the problem statements**
